Java DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to the Java DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository! This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems implemented in Java .
It serves as a reference for learning and improving problem-solving skills with a focus on data structures and algorithms.

Project Structure
The repository includes implementations of popular algorithms and problem-solving techniques, divided into categories such as:

* Sorting Algorithms: (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
* Searching Algorithms: (Binary Search, Mountain Search, Rotated Array Search, etc.)
* Recursion and Backtracking: (Permutations, Dice Sum, etc.)
* Array Manipulations: (Find Missing Number, Peak Element in Mountain Array, etc.)
* Miscellaneous: (Google Phone Number Problem, Amazon Dice Sum, etc.)
* Each Java file corresponds to a specific problem or algorithm, and the code is optimized for efficiency.
